# 🎉 It’s Finally Live!
 
After weeks of late nights, iterations, and deep dives into data — I’m thrilled to unveil the Team Performance Dashboard I built using Power BI for Nexaro Systems! 💪📊

This has been a passion project for me — something I’ve been working on for quite some time. From designing intuitive layouts and writing complex DAX measures, to visualizing insights that actually drive action — this dashboard represents a huge milestone in my data journey.

# ✨ What’s Inside?
 ✔️ Full 360° view of team performance – leads, meetings, and conversions
 ✔️ Individual scorecards with dynamic filtering
 ✔️ Trend forecasting and lead tracking
 ✔️ State-wise lead distribution with actionable insights
 ✔️ Top performer spotlight (shoutout to Alex Morgan & Jordan Blake!)
 ✔️ Interactive service-level breakdowns and more!

# 🔥 Why I’m Excited:
 This isn’t just a dashboard — it’s a living, breathing performance command center that translates complex data into clear, strategic insights. It’s built to support decision-makers, celebrate top contributors, and highlight where we can do better.

# 📌 Technologies Used:
 Power BI, DAX, advanced modeling, custom visuals, user-centered design principles.
